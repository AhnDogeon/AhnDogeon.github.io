[{"categories":null,"content":"Initial Post This article offers a sample of basic Markdown syntax that can be used in Hugo content files. Note This article is a shameful copy of the great Grav original page. If you want to know about the extented Markdown syntax of LoveIt theme, please read extended Markdown syntax page. Let’s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages. Markdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it. Some of the key benefits are: Markdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters, so it’s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use! John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this: The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. – John Gruber Without further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like!

Headings Headings from h2 through h6 are constructed with a # for each level: ","date":"2022-07-30","objectID":"/initial_post/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"Initial_post","uri":"/initial_post/"},{"categories":null,"content":"h2 Heading ","date":"2022-07-30","objectID":"/initial_post/:1:0","tags":null,"title":"Initial_post","uri":"/initial_post/"},{"categories":null,"content":"h3 Heading h4 Heading h5 Heading h6 Heading The HTML looks like this: h2 Heading h3 Heading h4 Heading h5 Heading h6 Heading Heading IDs To add a custom heading ID, enclose the custom ID in curly braces on the same line as the heading: ","date":"2022-07-30","objectID":"/initial_post/:1:1","tags":null,"title":"Initial_post","uri":"/initial_post/"},{"categories":null,"content":"A Great Heading The HTML looks like this: ","date":"2022-07-30","objectID":"/initial_post/:1:2","tags":null,"title":"Initial_post","uri":"/initial_post/"},{"categories":null,"content":"A Great Heading Comments Comments should be HTML compatible. Comment below should NOT be seen: Horizontal Rules The HTML element is for creating a “thematic break” between paragraph-level elements. In Markdown, you can create a with any of the following: ___: three consecutive underscores —: three consecutive dashes ***: three consecutive asterisks The rendered output looks like this: Body Copy Body copy written as normal, plain text will be wrapped with tags in the rendered HTML. So this body copy: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel, at duo primis mandamus. Et legere ocurreret pri, animal tacimates complectitur ad cum. Cu eum inermis inimicus efficiendi. Labore officiis his ex, soluta officiis concludaturque ei qui, vide sensibus vim ad. The HTML looks like this: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel, at duo primis mandamus. Et legere ocurreret pri, animal tacimates complectitur ad cum. Cu eum inermis inimicus efficiendi. Labore officiis his ex, soluta officiis concludaturque ei qui, vide sensibus vim ad. A line break can be done with one blank line. Inline HTML If you need a certain HTML tag (with a class) you can simply use HTML: Paragraph in Markdown. This is HTML Paragraph in Markdown. 6.

Blockquotes For quoting blocks of content from another source within your document. Add \u003e before any text you want to quote: Fusion Drive combines a hard drive with a flash storage (solid-state drive) and presents it as a single logical volume with the space of both drives combined. The rendered output looks like this: Fusion Drive combines a hard drive with a flash storage (solid-state drive) and presents it as a single logical volume with the space of both drives combined. The HTML looks like this: Fusion Drive combines a hard drive with a flash storage (solid-state drive) and presents it as a single logical volume with the space of both drives combined. Blockquotes can also be nested: Donec massa lacus, ultricies a ullamcorper in, fermentum sed augue. Nunc augue augue, aliquam non hendrerit ac, commodo vel nisi. Sed adipiscing elit vitae augue consectetur a gravida nunc vehicula. Donec auctor odio non est accumsan facilisis. Aliquam id turpis in dolor tincidunt mollis ac eu diam. The rendered output looks like this: Donec massa lacus, ultricies a ullamcorper in, fermentum sed augue. Nunc augue augue, aliquam non hendrerit ac, commodo vel nisi. Sed adipiscing elit vitae augue consectetur a gravida nunc vehicula. Donec auctor odio non est accumsan facilisis. Aliquam id turpis in dolor tincidunt mollis ac eu diam. Lists 8.1. Unordered A list of items in which the order of the items does not explicitly matter. You may use any of the following symbols to denote bullets for each list item: valid bullet valid bullet valid bullet For example: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet Consectetur adipiscing elit Integer molestie lore","date":"2022-07-30","objectID":"/initial_post/:1:3","tags":null,"title":"Initial_post","uri":"/initial_post/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Table of Contents Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 will jump to these sections: ","date":"2022-07-30","objectID":"/initial_post/:2:0","tags":null,"title":"Initial_post","uri":"/initial_post/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Chapter 1 Content for chapter one.

Note The specific placement of the anchor tag seems to be arbitrary. They are placed inline here since it seems to be unobtrusive, and it works. Footnotes Footnotes allow you to add notes and references without cluttering the body of the document. When you create a footnote, a superscript number with a link appears where you added the footnote reference. Readers can click the link to jump to the content of the footnote at the bottom of the page. To create a footnote reference, add a caret and an identifier inside brackets (1). Identifiers can be numbers or words, but they can’t contain spaces or tabs. Identifiers only correlate the footnote reference with the footnote itself — in the output, footnotes are numbered sequentially. Add the footnote using another caret and number inside brackets with a colon and text (1: My footnote.). You don’t have to put footnotes at the end of the document. You can put them anywhere except inside other elements like lists, block quotes, and tables. This is a digital footnote1. This is a footnote with “label”2 This is a footnote with “label\"2 Images Images have a similar syntax to links but include a preceding exclamation point. Minion or: The Stormtroopocat Alt text Like links, images also have a footnote style syntax: The Dojocat Alt text With a reference later in the document defining the URL location: Footnotes This is a digital footnote ↩ This is a footnote with “label” ↩ This is a digital footnote ↩︎ ↩︎ ↩︎ This is a footnote with “label” This is a digital footnote1. ↩︎ ","date":"2022-07-30","objectID":"/initial_post/:5:0","tags":null,"title":"Initial_post","uri":"/initial_post/"}]
